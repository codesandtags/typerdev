# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depend on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x     | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do the following:

1. **Do not open an issue.** This ensures that the vulnerability is not publicly disclosed until we can address it.
2. Send an email to [codesandtags@gmail.com](mailto:codesandtags@gmail.com) with the following details:
   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - Any potential impact it may have.
   - Any suggested fixes or mitigations.

We will respond to your email within 48 hours to acknowledge receipt. We will then work to understand and address the issue as quickly as possible. Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will notify you and give you credit for the discovery if you wish.

## Security Updates

We will release security updates as needed. Users are encouraged to update to the latest version to ensure they have the latest security patches.

## Security Best Practices

To help ensure the security of your application, we recommend the following best practices:

- Regularly update dependencies.
- Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) where possible.
- Regularly back up your data.
- Monitor your application for unusual activity.
